# Forest

Forest language is an embedded programming language (in the sense that it can be easily embedded in another language). It's meant as a base for programming languages desiged for expressing computations or business logic in the way that is especially easy to follow by humans.

This repository contains wrappers for host-language functions and tests for them.
